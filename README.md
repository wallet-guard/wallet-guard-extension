# Detect and Block Malicious Websites

Wallet Guard's Proactive Phishing Protection uses an ensemble of machine learning models to check for common phishing attack methods such as recently created domains, homoglyph translations and impersonation attempts.

# Transaction Simulations

What's the benefit of Transaction Simulations?
The blockchain can be scary without knowing what you're doing!

- Transaction Simulations will enable you to understand exactly what is entering and leaving your wallet on any transaction!
- This human readable context + a friendly UI will help defeat many scams we see in web3.
- Wallet Guard's transaction simulation also works in tandem with our proactive phishing detection to provide deeper insights on transactions!

# How are we proxying transactions

Like MetaMask, Wallet Guard injects the Ethereum web3 API into the JavaScript context of any website, enabling the secure reading and verification of transaction requests from decentralized applications (dApps).

Wallet Guard acts as an intermediary between your browser and wallet, analyzing transactions without modification. Once youâ€™ve made a decision, we return the transaction to your wallet without any changes, allowing Wallet Guard to operate seamlessly in the background.

```typescript
  if (provider && !provider?.isWalletGuard) {
    log.debug({ provider }, 'Added proxy');

    try {
      Object.defineProperty(provider, 'request', {
        value: new Proxy(provider.request, requestHandler),
      });
      Object.defineProperty(provider, 'send', {
        value: new Proxy(provider.send, sendHandler),
      });
      Object.defineProperty(provider, 'sendAsync', {
        value: new Proxy(provider.sendAsync, sendAsyncHandler),
      });
      provider.isWalletGuard = true;
      console.log('Wallet Guard is running!');
    } catch (error) {
      console.log('Wallet Guard could not start!');
    }
  }
};

```
